A note when coming up with parases, come up with about 12, to help train the API correctly.

Use a webhook that google can call to process a Google Home response
It needs to parse the in coming request and returning a properly formated response

npm install actions-on-google --save

under fulliment go to webhook and enabled then change url to actual api location

at bottom of intent page, click use webhook


use training to set actual intents


need to make sure to have a quit api to end

use Actions on google to test it out
